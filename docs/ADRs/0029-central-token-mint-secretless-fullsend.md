## Context

The Fullsend run layer security model must constrain two risks: unauthorized access to model APIs, and impersonation of Fullsend agents on the forge. The current architecture keeps LLM credentials and per-role GitHub App private keys as GitHub Actions secrets in the org’s `.fullsend` config repo, relies on org admins to protect that repo, and assumes only workflows defined there can read those secrets ([ADR 0007](0007-per-role-github-apps.md), [ADR 0008](0008-workflow-dispatch-for-cross-repo-dispatch.md)).

That layout has operational costs: enrolled repos must trigger `.fullsend` via `workflow_dispatch` authenticated with a long-lived fine-grained PAT so that caller-scoped secrets do not block access to PEMs in the config repo ([ADR 0008](0008-workflow-dispatch-for-cross-repo-dispatch.md)). Because those workflows can use the App keys, each org historically needed its own agent apps to avoid cross-org permission leakage. GitHub’s controls also make fully automated PAT and App lifecycle painful, which works against hands-off deployment.

Workload identity federation and related patterns already move LLM access toward short-lived, non-repo-stored credentials (see [ADR 0025](0025-provider-credential-delivery-for-sandboxed-agents.md) and [security-threat-model.md](../problems/security-threat-model.md)). The remaining gap is GitHub agent identity: if App secrets leave the `.fullsend` repo, dispatch can revert to `workflow_call`, and orgs can stop minting their own Apps and PATs for baseline installs. That shift interacts with [ADR 0026](0026-stage-based-dispatch-for-agent-workflow-decoupling.md), which decouples shims from specific agent workflows via a stage-based dispatcher (`dispatch.yml`, stage markers, `gh workflow run` fan-out). [ADR 0026](0026-stage-based-dispatch-for-agent-workflow-decoupling.md) assumes [ADR 0008](0008-workflow-dispatch-for-cross-repo-dispatch.md)’s `workflow_dispatch` + PAT boundary between enrolled repos and `.fullsend`; it does not define a separate trust model beyond preserving that split. Moving to `workflow_call` and mint-issued tokens updates that assumption while keeping stage-based decoupling.

This direction is **complementary** to [ADR 0025](0025-provider-credential-delivery-for-sandboxed-agents.md) (short-lived provider access) and **orthogonal** to [ADR 0009](0009-pull-request-target-in-shim-workflows.md) (shim trigger context). [ADR 0014](0014-admin-install-github-apps-secrets-v1.md) and installer specs will need follow-on updates for where PEMs live, without reversing per-role App semantics.

This decision **reverses** [ADR 0008](0008-workflow-dispatch-for-cross-repo-dispatch.md)’s use of `workflow_dispatch` with an org-scoped dispatch PAT for the enrolled-repo → `.fullsend` boundary. ADR 0008 chose that pattern because `workflow_call` could not expose config-repo secrets to the called workflow. Centralizing App private keys in a token mint removes the need for PEMs as repo secrets, so that constraint no longer applies and shims can integrate via `workflow_call`, eliminating the dispatch PAT for that path (subject to cutover / compatibility if PAT mode remains supported).

## Relationship to prior ADRs (summary)

- **[ADR 0007](0007-per-role-github-apps.md) — partially revised:** Per-role Apps and least-privilege by role remain goals; **PEM storage and default provisioning** move to the mint + shared Apps for the default path.
- **[ADR 0008](0008-workflow-dispatch-for-cross-repo-dispatch.md) — reversed (mechanism):** `workflow_dispatch` + dispatch PAT was required so `.fullsend` could use repo-stored PEMs without `workflow_call` secret scoping. Mint-held keys remove that requirement.
- **[ADR 0026](0026-stage-based-dispatch-for-agent-workflow-decoupling.md) — preserved in intent:** Stage-based indirection and marker fan-out remain; only the cross-repo **trigger and authentication** assumptions inherited from 0008 change when moving to `workflow_call` + OIDC-to-mint.
- **[ADR 0025](0025-provider-credential-delivery-for-sandboxed-agents.md) — aligned:** Same “no long-lived secrets in `.fullsend`” direction for forge identity, alongside provider-based LLM access.
- **[ADR 0009](0009-pull-request-target-in-shim-workflows.md) — orthogonal:** Does not change `pull_request_target` reasoning; only how the shim calls `.fullsend` and how `.fullsend` obtains GitHub tokens.

## Options

- **Status quo:** Keep PEMs and any remaining provider secrets in `.fullsend`, retain `workflow_dispatch` and the org-level dispatch PAT, and keep per-org GitHub Apps ([ADR 0007](0007-per-role-github-apps.md), [ADR 0008](0008-workflow-dispatch-for-cross-repo-dispatch.md)).
- **Central mint + shared apps (this ADR):** Operate a token mint that alone holds App credentials; `.fullsend` workflows prove workload identity via OIDC and receive short-lived, org-scoped forge tokens.

## Decision

Adopt a **central token mint** and **public, shared GitHub Apps** as the default way to give Fullsend agents forge identity, so the `.fullsend` repository needs **no long-lived secrets** for LLM access or App private keys.

1. **Shared Apps.** Define a small set of well-known GitHub Apps (per agent role or equivalent) that all adopting orgs install. Private keys live only with the mint service, not in each org’s config repo.
2. **Token mint.** The mint accepts OIDC tokens from approved workloads (GitHub Actions today), verifies that the caller is an allowed workflow from the expected `.fullsend` repository (e.g. using claims such as `job_workflow_ref`), and returns a **short-lived, org-scoped** token suitable for impersonating the correct App installation for that run.
3. **Workflow integration.** `.fullsend` workflows obtain forge tokens from the mint when they need GitHub API access instead of reading PEM secrets locally.
4. **Deployment profiles.** Multiple mint instances may exist (e.g. vendor-operated vs community-operated), each paired with its own App registrations and trust policies; orgs choose which mint to trust rather than creating bespoke Apps and PATs for the default path.
5. **Extensibility.** The same mint pattern can be extended to other CI platforms by validating that platform’s OIDC or workload tokens (e.g. Tekton pipeline service account tokens), and to other SCMs by minting the equivalent bot credentials once those forges are supported.

Non-sensitive configuration that today is stored as secrets only for convenience may move to org-level Actions variables or similar once the mint is authoritative for true secrets.

## Consequences

- For the default path, `.fullsend` no longer stores App PEMs or model API secrets; enrollment and rotation shift toward mint configuration, shared App installation, and OIDC trust—not repo secret churn alone.
- Shim workflows can call `.fullsend` via **`workflow_call`**, removing the **org-level dispatch PAT** (`FULLSEND_DISPATCH_TOKEN`) for that integration path (subject to a defined cutover / compatibility mode if PAT mode remains supported).
- Org onboarding emphasizes **installing shared Apps** and **trusting a mint endpoint** (and optional deployment profile) rather than generating per-org Apps and PATs for baseline installs.
- The mint and its backing key material become a **high-value aggregate target**: compromise can affect **every org** using that mint profile, unlike compromise of a single org’s `.fullsend` repo secrets.
- **Blast radius (mint compromise):** An attacker who can mint or alter mint policy may obtain **short-lived tokens scoped to installations** the shared Apps already have in victim orgs—potentially acting as **any** Fullsend agent role those Apps represent, across repos those installations can reach. If a **review** (or similarly privileged) App installation can **approve merges** or satisfy branch protections, mint compromise could enable **self-approval** or **merge** paths at scale until keys are revoked and tokens expire. Mitigations include mint hardening, monitoring, key ceremony, narrow installations, and human CODEOWNERS / branch rules—not only repo secret placement.
- **Trust binding:** Reliance on OIDC claims such as **`job_workflow_ref`** (and related issuer/subject rules) is security-critical: the mint must only tokenize callers that match **pinned, expected workflow definitions** in the real `.fullsend` repo (and org/repo rules you define). Spoofing a **fake** `.fullsend` in another org still yields tokens **scoped to that attacker’s org installations**, not cross-tenant access to unrelated orgs—but within an org, impact can still be severe.
- **Availability:** Centralizing token issuance creates a **shared dependency**: if the mint is unreachable or unhealthy, agent workflows that depend on minted tokens may **stall** across dependent orgs (a **shared SPOF** unless you operate redundant endpoints, caches, or explicit fallback modes). This trades **per-repo secret sprawl and PAT operations** for **central operational responsibility** (uptime, incident response, key management).
- Follow-on ADRs or normative specs should spell out cutover, PAT compatibility mode, and concrete dispatcher/shim wiring. When **this** ADR is **Accepted**, updates to older ADRs and living docs follow repo supersession rules ([ADR 0001](0001-use-adrs-for-decision-making.md)): **accepted** ADRs are not rewritten—only **status** and links to the successor—while [`docs/architecture.md`](../architecture.md) carries current truth. A checklist for **[ADR 0007](0007-per-role-github-apps.md)**, **[ADR 0008](0008-workflow-dispatch-for-cross-repo-dispatch.md)**, and **[ADR 0026](0026-stage-based-dispatch-for-agent-workflow-decoupling.md)** is posted on the pull request for when this ADR is merged as Accepted.
